# ShinyStatsPHP
Self hosted clone of https://shinyrates.com

We've been running this Version for a few months now, but changing to Golbat gave us the motivation to clean it up and extend functionality a little bit.
Thanks to versx for a great base, i have no idea what i'm doing and its mostly hacking stuff together with chatgpt and help from others, so if you find any errors, feel free to improve the script

Notes additions to the Original (in no particular order):

- Shiny, Hundo and Nundo Stats on one Page
- Support for German and English Pokedex Versions, switchable on the Page
- Calender Picker for Stats History
- Sorting
- way more Stats like Shiny Rate in %, Total Stats, Rarity
- "Rarity" is the Chance of getting a specific Pkmn based on all spawns, like when you play casually and click on every pkmn
